# AFA-PerformanceEval
Realistic Synthetic Stress profiles for vdbench and others
- vdbench profiles (.vdb files) + scripts are provided for single or multi-hosts stress
  Profiles imitate the following workloads :
  - Oracles-DB like (± 3.9:1 Data Reduction Rate)
  - VSI like (± 5.2:1 DDR)
  - SQL-Server like (± 2.5:1 DDR)
  - VDI like (± 10:1 DDR)
  
- fio examples are also given since this tool is DataReduction aware
- no IOZone, IOMeter, etc : non-realistic Synthetic Stress tools are banished here !
